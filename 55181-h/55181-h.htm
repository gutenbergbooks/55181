<h2>THE IRISH MIDWIFE, <span class="smcap">Part III</span>.&mdash;DANDY KEHO’S CHRISTENING.<br />
<span class="smaller">BY WILLIAM CARLETON.</span></h2>

<p>The following Sunday morning, Rose paid an early visit to
her patient, for, as it was the day of young Dandy’s christening,
her presence was considered indispensable. There is,
besides, something in the appearance and bearing of a midwife
upon those occasions which diffuses a spirit of buoyancy and
light-heartedness not only through the immediate family, but
also through all who may happen to participate in the ceremony,
or partake of the good cheer. In many instances it is
known that the very presence of a medical attendant communicates
such a cheerful confidence to his patient, as, independently
of any prescription, is felt to be a manifest relief. So
is it with the midwife; with this difference, that she exercises
a greater and more comical latitude of consolation than the
doctor, although it must be admitted that the one generally
falls woefully short of that conventional dress with which we
cover nudity of expression. No doubt many of her very
choicest stock jokes, to carry on the metaphor, are a little too
<em>fashionably</em> dressed to pass current out of the sphere in which
they are used; but be this as it may, they are <em>so</em> traditional in
character, and so humorous in conception, that we never
knew the veriest prude to feel offended, or the morosest temperament
to maintain its sourness, at their recital. Not that
she is at all gross or unwomanly in any thing she may say,
but there is generally in her apothegms a passing touch of
fancy&mdash;a quick but terse vivacity of insinuation, at once so
full of fun and sprightliness, and that truth which all know
but few like to acknowledge, that we defy any one not irretrievably
gone in some incurable melancholy to resist her
humour. The moment she was seen approaching the house,
every one in it felt an immediate elevation of spirits, with the
exception of Mrs Keho herself, who knew that wherever
Rose had the arrangement of the bill of fare, there was sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
to be what the Irish call “full an’ plinty”&mdash;“lashins an’
lavins”&mdash;a fact which made her groan in spirit at the bare
contemplation of such waste and extravagance. She was
indeed a woman of a very un-Irish heart&mdash;so sharp in her temper
and so penurious in soul, that one would imagine her veins
were filled with vinegar instead of blood.</p>

<p>“<i lang="ga">Banaght Dheah in shoh</i>” (the blessing of God be here),
Rose exclaimed on entering.</p>

<p>“<i lang="ga">Banaght Dheah agus Murra ghuid</i>” (the blessing of God
and the Virgin on you), replied Corny, “an’ you’re welcome,
Rose ahagur.”</p>

<p>“I know that, Corny. Well, how are we?&mdash;how is my son?”</p>

<p>“Begarra, thrivin’ like a pair o’ throopers.”</p>

<p>“Thank God for it! Hav’n’t we a good right to be grateful
to him any way? An’ is my little man to be christened
to-day?”</p>

<p>“Indeed he is&mdash;the gossips will be here presently, an’ so
will <em>her</em> mother. But, Rose, dear, will you take the ordherin’
of the aitin’ an’ drinkin’ part of it?&mdash;you’re betther up to these
things than we are, an’ so you ought, of coorse. Let there
be no want of any thing; an’ if there’s an overplush, sorra
may care; there’ll be poor mouths enough about the door for
whatever’s left. So, you see, keep never mindin’ any hint <em>she</em>
may give you&mdash;you know she’s a little o’ the closest; but no
matther. Let there, as I said, be enough an’ to spare.”</p>

<p>“Throth, there spoke your father’s son, Corny; all the
ould dacency’s not dead yet, any how. Well, I’ll do my best.
But she’s not fit to be up, you know, an’ of coorse can’t disturb
us.” The expression of her eye could not be misunderstood
as she uttered this. “I see,” said Corny&mdash;“devil a
betther, if you manage that, all’s right.”</p>

<p>“An’ now I must go in, till I see how she an’ my son’s
gettin’ an: that’s always my first start; bekase you know,
Corny, honey, that <em>their</em> health goes afore every thing.”</p>

<p>Having thus undertaken the task required of her, she passed
into the bedroom of Mrs Keho, whom she found determined
to be up, in order, as she said, to be at the head of her own
table.</p>

<p>“Well, alanna, if you must, you must; but in the name of
goodness I wash my hands out of the business teetotally.
Dshk, dshk, dshk! Oh, wurra! to think of a woman in your
state risin’ to sit at her own table! That I may never, if I’ll
see it, or be about the place at all. If you take your life by
your own wilfulness, why, God forgive you; but it mustn’t
be while I’m here. But since you’re bent on it, why, give me
the child, an’ afore I go, any how, I may as well dress it,
poor thing! The heavens pity it&mdash;my little man&mdash;eh?&mdash;where
was it?&mdash;cheep&mdash;that’s it, a ducky; stretch away.
Aye stretchin’ an’ thrivin’ an, my son! Oh, thin, wurra! Mrs
Keho, but it’s you that ought to ax God’s pardon for goin’ to
do what might lave that darlin’ o’ the world an orphan, may
be. Arrah be the vestments, if I can have patience wid you.
May God pity you, my child. If anything happened your mother,
what ’ud become of you, and what ’ud become of your
poor father this day? Dshk, dshk, dshk!” These latter
sounds, exclamations of surprise and regret, were produced
by striking the tongue against that part of the inward gum
which covers the roots of the teeth.</p>

<p>“Indeed, Rose,” replied her patient, in her sharp, shrill, quick
voice, “I’m able enough to get up; if I don’t, we’ll be harrished.
Corny’s a fool, an’ it’ll be only rap an’ rive wid every one in
the place.”</p>

<p>“Wait, ma’am, if you plaise. Where’s his little barrow?
Ay, I have it. Wait, ma’am, if you plaise, till I get the child
dressed, an’ I’ll soon take myself out o’ this. Heaven presarve
us! I have seen the like o’ this afore&mdash;ay have I&mdash;where
it was as clear as crystal <em>that there was something
over them</em>&mdash;ay, over them that took their own way as you’re
doin’.”</p>

<p>“But if I don’t get up”&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh, by all manes, ma’am&mdash;by all manes. I suppose you
have a laise o’ your life, that’s all. It’s what I wish I could
get.”</p>

<p>“An’ must I stay here in bed all day, an’ me able to rise,
an’ sich wilful waste as will go an too?”</p>

<p>“Remember you’re warned. This is your first baby, God
bless it, an’ spare you both. But, Mrs Keho, does it stand to
raison that you’re as good a judge of these things as a woman
like me, that it’s my business? I ax you that, ma’am.”</p>

<p>This poser in fact settled the question, not only by the
reasonable force of the conclusion to be derived from it, but
by the cool authoritative manner in which it was put.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the other, “in that case, I suppose, I must
give in. You ought to know best.”</p>

<p>“Thank you kindly, ma’am; have you found it out at last?
No, but you ought to put your two hands under my feet
for preventin’ you from doin’ what you intinded. That
I may never sup sorrow, but it was as much as your life
was worth. Compose yourself; I’ll see that there’s no waste,
and that’s enough. Here, hould my son&mdash;why, thin, isn’t he
the beauty o’ the world, now that he has got his little dress
upon him?&mdash;till I pin up this apron across the windy; the
light’s too strong for you. There now: the light’s apt to give one
a headache when it comes in full bint upon the eyes that way.
Come, alanna, come an now, till I show you to your father
an’ them all. Wurra, thin, Mrs Keho, darlin’,” (this was said
in a low confidential whisper, and in a playful wheedling tone
which baffles all description), “wurra, thin, Mrs Keho, darlin’,
but it’s he that’s the proud man, the proud Corny, this
day. Rise your head a little&mdash;aisy&mdash;there now, that’ll do&mdash;one
kiss to my son, now, before he laives his mammy, he says, for
a weeny while, till he pays his little respects to his daddy an’
to all his friends, he says, an’ thin he’ll come back to
mammy agin&mdash;to his own little bottle, he says.”</p>

<p>Young Corny soon went the rounds of the whole family,
from his father down to the little herd-boy who followed and
took care of the cattle. Many were the jokes which passed
between the youngsters on this occasion&mdash;jokes which have
been registered by such personages as Rose, almost in
every family in the kingdom, for centuries, and with which
most of the Irish people are too intimately and thoroughly
acquainted to render it necessary for us to repeat them
here.</p>

<p>Rose now addressed herself to the task of preparing breakfast,
which, in honour of the happy event, was nothing
less than “tay, white bread, and Boxty,” with a glass of poteen
to sharpen the appetite. As Boxty, however, is a description
of bread not generally known to our readers, we shall
give them a sketch of the manner in which this Irish luxury is
made. A basket of the best potatoes is got, which are
washed and peeled raw; then is procured a tin grater, on
which they are grated; the water is then shired off them, and
the macerated mass is put into a clean sheet, or table-cloth, or
bolster-cover. This is caught at each end by two strong
men, who twist it in opposite directions until the contortions
drive up the substance into the middle of the sheet, &amp;c.; this
of course expels the water also; but lest the twisting should
be insufficient for that purpose, it is placed, like a cheese-cake,
under a heavy weight, until it is properly dried. They then
knead it into cakes, and bake it on a pan or griddle; and when
eaten with butter, we can assure our readers that it is quite
delicious.</p>

<p>The hour was now about nine o’clock, and the company
asked to the christening began to assemble. The gossips or
sponsors were four in number; two of them wealthy friends
of the family that had never been married, and the two others
a simple country pair, who were anxious to follow in the matrimonial
steps of Corny and his wife. The rest were, as
usual, neighbours, relatives, and <i lang="ga">cleaveens</i>, to the amount of
sixteen or eighteen persons, men, women, and children, all
dressed in their best apparel, and disposed to mirth and friendship.
Along with the rest was Bob M’Cann, the fool, who
by the way could smell out a good dinner with as keen a
nostril as the wisest man in the parish could boast of, and
who on such occasions carried turf and water in quantities
that indicated the supernatural strength of a Scotch brownie
rather than that of a human being. Bob’s qualities, however,
were well proportioned to each other, for, truth to say,
his appetite was equal to his strength, and his cunning to
either.</p>

<p>Corny and Mrs Moan were in great spirits, and indeed
we might predicate as much of all who were present. Not
a soul entered the house who was not brought up by Corny
to an out-shot room, as a private mark of his friendship,
and treated to an underhand glass of as good poteen “as
ever went down the red lane,” to use a phrase common among
the people. Nothing upon an occasion naturally pleasant
gives conversation a more cheerful impulse than this; and the
consequence was, that in a short time the scene was animated
and mirthful to an unusual degree.</p>

<p>Breakfast at length commenced in due form. Two bottles
of whisky were placed upon the table, and the first thing
done was to administer a glass to each guest.</p>

<p>“Come, neighbours,” said Corny, “we must dhrink the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
good woman’s health before we ate, especially as it’s the first
time, any how.”</p>

<p>“To be sure they will, achora, an’ why not? An’ if it’s
the first time, Corny, it won’t be the&mdash;&mdash; Musha! you’re welcome,
Mrs &mdash;&mdash;! an’ jist in time too”&mdash;this she said, addressing
his mother-in-law, who then entered. “Look at this
swaddy, Mrs &mdash;&mdash;; my soul to happiness, but he’s fit to be
the son of a lord. Eh, a pet? Where was my darlin’?
Corny, let me dip my finger in the whisky till I rub his
gums wid it. That’s my bully! Oh, the heavens love it, see
how it puts the little mouth about lookin’ for it agin. Throth
you’ll have the spunk in you yet, acushla, an’ it’s a credit to
the Kehos you’ll be, if you’re spared, as you will, plaise the
heavens!”</p>

<p>“Well, Corny,” said one of the gossips, “here’s a speedy
uprise an’ a sudden recovery to the good woman, an’ the little
sthranger’s health, an’ God bless the baker that gives
thirteen to the dozen, any how!”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, Paddy Rafferty, you’ll have your joke any way;
an’, throth, you’re welcome to it, Paddy; if you weren’t, it
isn’t standin’ for young Corny you’d be to-day.”</p>

<p>“Thrue enough,” said Rose, “an’, by the dickens, Paddy
isn’t the boy to be long under an obligation to any one. Eh,
Paddy, did I help you there, avick? Aisy, childre; you’ll
smother my son if you crush about him that way.” This was
addressed to some of the youngsters, who were pressing
round to look at and touch the infant.</p>

<p>“It won’t be my fault if I do, Rose,” said Paddy, slyly
eyeing Peggy Betagh, then betrothed to him, who sat opposite,
her dark eyes flashing with repressed humour and affection.
Deafness, however, is sometimes a very convenient
malady to young ladies, for Peggy immediately commenced a
series of playful attentions to the unconscious infant, which
were just sufficient to excuse her from noticing this allusion
to their marriage. Rose looked at her, then nodded comically
to Paddy, shutting both her eyes by way of a wink,
adding aloud, “Throth you’ll be the happy boy, Paddy; an’
woe betide you if you aren’t the sweetest end of a honeycomb
to her. Take care an’ don’t bring me upon you. Well, Peggy,
never mind, alanna; who has a betther right to his joke
than the dacent boy that’s&mdash;aisy, childre: saints above!
but ye’ll smother the child, so you will.&mdash;Where did I get him,
Dinney? sure I brought him as a present to Mrs Keho; I
never come but I bring a purty little babby along wid me&mdash;than
the dacent boy, dear, that’s soon to be your lovin’ husband?
Arrah, take your glass, acushla; the sorrabarm it’ll do
you.”</p>

<p>“Bedad, I’m afeard, Mrs Moan. What if it ’ud get into
my head, an’ me’s to stand for my little godson? No, bad
scran to me if I could&mdash;faix, a glass ’ud be too many for me.”</p>

<p>“It’s not more than half tilled, dear; but there’s sense in
what the girl says, Dandy, so don’t press it an her.”</p>

<p>In the brief space allotted to us we could not possibly give
any thing like a full and correct picture of the happiness and
hilarity which prevailed at the breakfast in question. When
it was over, they all prepared to go to the parish chapel,
which was distant at least a couple of miles, the midwife staying
at home to see that all the necessary preparations were
made for dinner. As they were departing, Rose took the
Dandy aside, and addressed him thus:</p>

<p>“Now, Dandy, when you see the priest, tell him that it is
your wish, above all things, ‘that he should christen it against
the fairies.’ If you say that, it’s enough. And, Peggy, achora,
come here. You’re not carryin’ that child right, alanna; but
you’ll know betther yet, plaise goodness. No, avillish, don’t
keep its little head so closely covered wid your cloak; the day’s
a burnin’ day, glory be to God, an’ the Lord guard my child;
sure the least thing in the world, where there’s too much hait,
’ud smother my darlin’. Keep its head out farther, and just
shade its little face that way from the sun. Och, will I ever
forget the Sunday whin poor Molly M’Guigan wint to take
Pat Feasthalagh’s child from under her cloak to be christened,
the poor infant was a corpse; an’ only that the Lord put it
into my head to have it privately christened, the father an’
mother’s hearts would break. Glory be to God! Mrs Duggan,
if the child gets cross, dear, or misses any thing, act the
mother by him, the little man. Eh, alanna! where was it?
Where was my duck o’ diamonds&mdash;my little Con Roe?
My own sweety little ace o’ hearts&mdash;eh, alanna! Well, God
keep it, till I see it again, the jewel!”</p>

<p>Well, the child was baptized by the name of his father,
and the persons assembled, after their return from chapel,
lounged about Corny’s house, or took little strolls in the
neighbourhood, until the hour of dinner. This of course
was much more convivial, and ten times more vociferous, than
the breakfast, cheerful as that meal was. At dinner they had
a dish, which we believe is, like the Boxty, peculiarly Irish in
its composition: we mean what is called <i lang="ga">sthilk</i>. This consists
of potatoes and beans pounded up together in such a manner
that the beans are not broken, and on this account the potatoes
are well champed before the beans are put into them.
This is dished in a large bowl, and a hole made in the middle
of it, into which a <i lang="ga">miscaun</i> or roll of butter is thrust, and
then covered up until it is melted. After this, every one takes
a spoon and digs away with his utmost vigour, dipping every
morsel into the well of butter in the middle, before he puts it
into his mouth. Indeed, from the strong competition which
goes forward, and the rapid motion of each right hand, no
spectator could be mistaken in ascribing the motive of their
proceedings to the principle of the old proverb, devil take
the hindmost. <i lang="ga">Sthilk</i> differs from another dish made of potatoes
in much the same way, called <i lang="ga">colcannon</i>. If there were
beans, for instance, in <i lang="ga">colcannon</i>, it would be <i lang="ga">sthilk</i>. This
practice of many persons eating out of the same dish, though
Irish, and not cleanly, is of very old antiquity. Christ himself
mentions it at the Last Supper. Let us hope, however, that,
like the old custom which once prevailed in Ireland, of several
persons drinking at meals out of the same mether, the usage
we speak of will soon be replaced by one of more cleanliness
and individual comfort.</p>

<p>After dinner the whisky began to go round, for in these
days punch was a luxury almost unknown to the class we are
writing of. In fact, nobody there knew how to make it but
the midwife, who wisely kept the secret to herself, aware that
if the whisky were presented to them in such a palatable
shape, they would not know when to stop, and she herself
might fall short of the snug bottle that is usually kept as a
treat for those visits which she continues to pay during the
convalescence of her patients.</p>

<p>“Come, Rose,” said Corny, who was beginning to soften
fast, “it’s your turn now to thry a glass of what never seen
wather.” “I’ll take the glass, Dandy&mdash;deed will I&mdash;but the
thruth is, I never dhrink it <em>hard</em>. No, but I’ll jist take a drop
o’ hot wather an’ a grain o’ sugar, an’ scald it; that an’ as
much carraway seeds us will lie upon a sixpence does me
good; for, God help me, the stomach isn’t at all sthrong wid
me, in regard of bein’ up so much at night, an’ deprived of my
nathural rest.”</p>

<p>“Rose,” said one of them, “is it thrue that you war called
out one night, an’ brought blindfoulded to some grand lady
belongin’ to the quality?”</p>

<p>“Wait, avick, till I make a drop o’ <em>wan-grace</em><a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> for the
misthress, poor thing; an’, Corny, I’ll jist throuble you for
about a thimbleful o’ spirits to take the smell o’ the wather
off it. The poor creature, she’s a little weak still, an’ indeed
it’s wonderful how she stood it out; but, my dear, God’s good
to his own, an’ fits the back to the burden, praise be to his
name!”</p>

<p>She then proceeded to scald the drop of spirits for herself,
or, in other words, to mix a good tumbler of ladies’ punch,
making it, as the phrase goes, hot, strong, and sweet&mdash;not forgetting
the carraways, to give it a flavour. This being accomplished,
she made the wan-grace for Mrs Keho, still throwing
in a word now and then to sustain her part in the conversation,
which was now rising fast into mirth, laughter, and
clamour.</p>

<p>“Well, but, Rose, about the lady of quality, will you tell
us that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, many a thing happened me as well worth tellin’, if
you go to that; but I’ll tell it to you, childre, for sure the
curiosity’s nathural to yez. Why, I was one night at home
an’ asleep, an’ I hears a horse’s foot gallopin’ for the bare
life up to the door. I immediately put my head out, an’ the
horseman says, ‘Are you Mrs Moan?’</p>

<p>‘That’s the name that’s an me, your honour,’ says myself.</p>

<p>‘Dress yourself thin,’ says he, ‘for you’re sadly wanted;
dress yourself and mount behind me, for there’s not a moment
to be lost!’ At the same time I forgot to say that his
hat was tied about his face in sich a way that I couldn’t catch
a glimpse of it. Well, my dear, we didn’t let the grass grow
undher our feet for about a mile or so. ‘Now,’ says he, ‘you
must allow yourself to be blindfoulded, an’ it’s useless to oppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
it, for it must be done. There’s the character, may be
the life, of a great lady at stake; so be quiet till I cover your
eyes, or,’ says he, lettin’ out a great oath, ‘it’ll be worse for
you. I’m a desperate man;’ an’, sure enough, I could feel
the heart of him beatin’ undher his ribs, as if it would burst
in pieces. Well, my dears, what could I do in the hands of a
man that was strong and desperate. ‘So,’ says I, ‘cover
my eyes in welcome; only, for the lady’s sake, make no delay.’
Wid that he dashed his spurs into the poor horse, an’ he
foamin’ an’ smokin’ like a lime-kiln already. Any way, in
about half an hour I found myself in a grand bedroom; an’
jist as I was put into the door, he whishpers me to bring the
child to him in the next room, as soon as it would be born.
Well, sure I did so, afther lavin’ the mother in a fair way.
But what ’ud you have of it?&mdash;the first thing I see, lyin’ an
the table, was a purse of money an’ a case o’ pistols. Whin
I looked at him, I thought the devil, Lord guard us! was in
his face, he looked so black and terrible about the brows.
‘Now, my good woman,’ says he, ‘so far you’ve acted well,
but there’s more to be done yet. Take your choice of these
two,’ says he, ‘this purse, or the contents o’ one o’ these pistols,
as your reward. You must murdher the child upon the
spot.’ ‘In the name of God an’ his Mother, be you man or
devil, I defy you,’ says I; ‘no innocent blood ’ll ever be shed
by these hands.’ ‘I’ll give you ten minutes,’ says he, ‘to
put an end to that brat there;’ an’ wid that he cocked one o’
the pistols. My dears, I had nothin’ for it but to say <em>in</em> to
myself a <i lang="la">pather</i> an’ <i lang="la">ave</i> as fast as I could, for I thought it
was all over wid me. However, glory be to God! the prayers
gave me great stringth, an’ I spoke stoutly. ‘Whin the king
of Jerusalem,’ says I&mdash;‘an’ he was a greater man than ever you’ll
be&mdash;whin the king of Jerusalem ordhered the midwives of
Aigyp to put Moses to death, they wouldn’t do it, and God
preserved them in spite of him, king though he was,’ says I;
‘an’ from that day to this it was never known that a midwife
took away the life of the babe she aided into the world&mdash;No,
an’ I’m not goin’ to be the first that’ll do it.’ ‘The time is
out,’ says he, puttin’ the pistol to my ear, ‘but I’ll give you
one minute more.’ ‘Let me go to my knees first,’ says I; ‘an’
now may God have mercy on my sowl, for, bad as I am, I’m
willin’ to die, sooner than commit murdher an the innocent.’
He gave a start as I spoke, an’ threw the pistol down. ‘Ay,’
said he, ‘an the innocent&mdash;an the innocent&mdash;that is thrue!
But you are an extraordinary woman: you have saved that
child’s life, and previnted me from committing two great
crimes, for it was my intintion to murder you afther you had
murdered it.’ I thin, by his ordhers, brought the poor child
to its mother, and whin I came back to the room, ‘Take that
purse,’ says he, ‘an’ keep it as a reward for your honesty.’
‘Wid the help o’ God,’ says I, ‘a penny of it will never come
into my company, so it’s no use to ax me.’ ‘Well,’ says he,
‘afore you lave this, you must swear not to mintion to a livin’
sowl what has happened this night, for a year and a day.’ It
didn’t signify to me whether I mintioned it or not; so being
jack-indifferent about it, I tuck the oath, and kept it. He thin
bound my eyes agin, hoisted me up behind him, an’ in a short
time left me at home. Indeed, I wasn’t betther o’ the start
it tuck out o’ me for as good as six weeks afther!”</p>

<p>The company now began to grow musical; several songs
were sung; and when the evening got farther advanced, a
neighbouring fiddler was sent for, and the little party had a
dance in the barn, to which they adjourned lest the noise
might disturb Mrs Keho, had they held it in the dwelling-house.
Before this occurred, however, the “midwife’s glass”
went the round of the gossips, each of whom drank her
health, and dropped some silver, at the same time, into the
bottom of it. It was then returned to her, and with a smiling
face she gave the following toast:&mdash;“Health to the
parent stock! So long as it thrives, there will always be
branches! Corny Keho, long life an’ good health to you an’
yours! May your son live to see himself as happy as his
father! Youngsters, here’s that you may follow a good example!
The company’s health in general I wish; an’, Paddy
Rafferty, that you may never have a blind child but you’ll
have a lame one to lead it!&mdash;ha! ha! ha! What’s the world
widout a joke? I must see the good woman an’ my little
son afore I go; but as I won’t follow yez to the barn, I’ll bid
yez good night, neighbours, an’ the blessin’ of Rose Moan
be among yez!”</p>

<p>And so also do we take leave of our old friend Rose Moan,
the Irish Midwife, who we understand took her last leave of
the world only about a twelvemonth ago.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">THE BAROMETZ, OR TARTAN LAMB.</h2>

<p>Before steam and all the other facilities for travel had made us
so well acquainted with the productions of remote parts of
the earth as we are at present, every traveller on his return
astonished his auditors or the readers of his works with accounts
of monsters which existed only as the creations of his
ingenuity, and to give importance to his discoveries. One out
of many which could be produced, and which, as they may afford
innocent amusement, we purpose from time to time to bring
under the notice of the readers of the Penny Journal, we
lately met with in an account of Struy’s Travels through Russia,
Tartary, &amp;c., in the seventeenth century. The object of wonder
was in this case the Scythian or Tartarian lamb, a creature
which, it was stated, sprang from the ground like a plant, and,
restrained to the spot on which it was produced, devoured every
vegetable production within its reach, and was itself in turn
eaten by the wolves of the country. This singular production
has since been found to be nothing more than a plant of
the fern tribe, the <i lang="la">Aspedium barometz</i>, found occasionally
in arid plains, where scarcely any other vegetable production
can exist; it rises like many others of the tree ferns with a
rugged or shaggy stem; and the plant having decayed or been
uprooted by any accident, it is not impossible that by means
of a storm or otherwise it might be found supported on its
feet, namely, the stumps of the leaves; but that it pastured on
other plants, or was mistaken by the wolves for a lamb, although
speculations which the wonder-seeking traveller might
be tempted to indulge in, it need hardly be said are ornamental
additions introduced to suit the taste of the narrator, and
to pander to that love of the marvellous which prevailed in
the age in which he lived. The following is his account of
this wonderful plant-animal:&mdash;</p>

<p>“On the western side of the Volga there is an elevated salt
plain of great extent, but wholly uncultivated and uninhabited.
On this plain (which furnishes all the neighbouring countries
with salt) grows the boranez, or bornitch. This wonderful
plant has the shape and appearance of a lamb, with feet, head,
and tail distinctly formed. Boranez, in the language of Muscovy,
signifies a little lamb. Its skin is covered with very
white down, as soft as silk. The Tartars and Muscovites
esteem it highly, and preserve it with great care in their
houses, where I have seen many such lambs. The sailor who
gave me one of those precious plants found it in a wood, and
had its skin made into an under-waistcoat. I learned at
Astrican from those who were best acquainted with the subject,
that the lamb grows upon a stalk about three feet high,
that the part by which it is sustained is a kind of navel, and
that it turns itself round, and bends down to reach the herbage
which serves it for food. They also said that it dries up and
pines away when the grass fails. To this I objected, that the
languor and occasional withering might be natural to it, as
plants are accustomed to fade at certain times. To this they
replied, that they had also once thought so, but that numerous
experiments had proved the contrary to be the fact, such as
cutting away, or by other means corrupting or destroying the
grass all around it; after which they assured me that it fell
into a languishing state and decayed insensibly. These persons
also added, that the wolves are very fond of these vegetable
lambs, and devour them with avidity, because they resemble
in taste the animals whose name they bear, and that in fact
they have bones, blood, and flesh, and hence they are called
zoophytes, or plant-animals. Many other things I was likewise
told, which might, however, appear scarcely probable to
such as have not seen them.”</p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Method of making Tar at Archangel.</span>&mdash;They dig
a hole in the ground, of sufficient size, some two or three
fathoms deep, and little more than half way down they make
a platform of wood, and thereon heap earth about a foot deep,
except in the middle, where a hole is left in the form of a
tunnel. They then fill the pit with fir billets piled up from
the platform, and rising about a fathom or more above
ground, which part they wall about with turf and clay to
keep in the fire. They command the fire by quenching: for
which use they make a lixivium of the ashes of fir. When all is
ready, they set fire a-top, and keep the wood burning, but very
leisurely, till it has sunk within a foot or two of the partition;
and then they heave out the fire as fast as it is possible; for
if it once laid hold of the tar which is settled down into the
lower pit, it blows all up forthwith. These tar-pits take up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
a great deal of trouble, and many men to tend them during
the time of their burning, that the fire may descend even and
leisurely, whereby the tar may have time to soak out of the
wood, and settle down into the pit. As it comes from the
wood it is pure tar, but in the pit it mixes with water, which
issues from the wood also; therefore it is afterwards clarified.&mdash;<cite>Life
of Sir Dudley North.</cite></p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Aurora Borealis.</span>&mdash;According to Crantz, the Greenlanders

Greeks and Romans, and all the unenlightened people of the
middle ages, who, in the aurora borealis, and other fiery meteors,
saw fighting armies, flaming swords, chariots and spears,
battles and blood, and even thought that they heard the clashing
of arms and the sound of martial music. In the rainbow
the ancient inhabitants of the north discovered a bridge from
earth to heaven, and called it the bridge of the gods, which
was watched by a dog, whom no art could elude, and whose
auditory faculty was such, that he could hear the grass grow
or the wool on the sheep’s back; the Kamschatkadales make
of it a new garment for their aërial spirits, edged with fringes
of red-coloured seal-skin, and leather thongs of various gaudy

<h2 class="gap4">ANIMAL CHARMING,<br />
<span class="smaller">OR THE SUBJUGATION OF ANIMALS BY MEANS OF
CHARMS, SPELLS, OR DRUGS.</span></h2>

<h3>Third and Concluding Article.</h3>

<p>In my last paper I endeavoured to show how exceedingly
absurd and unfounded was the notion of the Abbé Dubois and
Denon, that the serpent-charmers of India were and are a
set of juggling impostors, who practise on the credulity of the
vulgar, and vainly set forward pretensions to an art which
has no actual existence, and which, consequently, possesses
no legitimate claims on the attention of the philosophic inquirer.
I now wish to bring all that I would observe upon
this very curious subject to a conclusion. I acknowledge my
inability to furnish my readers with a thorough explanation
of the means by which these wonders are performed, but I
think I may be able, at all events, to suggest such hints as
may place them on the direct path to the attainment of the
knowledge they desire; after which, nothing will be necessary
but some degree of research and perseverance to afford them
a complete gratification of their wishes.</p>

<p>It is evident, that whatever may be the supplementary
means employed in serpent-charming, music is necessary to
its accomplishment. I should not be satisfied on this point
were it merely dependent upon the assertions of the jugglers
themselves, as in such case it might not unnaturally
be set down as a mere external cloak for some more important
secret which the performers did not wish to be discovered;
and for this reason I made the observation in my first article
on this subject, that the precise importance of the music in
these operations was not as yet entirely apparent. I wish it
to be understood, however, that although the degree of importance
in which music should be held as an adjunct to the
charming of snakes, or as a primary part of the process, has
not as yet been ascertained by those who have investigated
or endeavoured to investigate the business, and published the
results of their inquiries, I for my part am fully satisfied
on the subject. To return, however, to our more immediate
matter of discussion.</p>

<p>Many have conceived that serpent-charming depends in the
first instance upon the snakes being previously deprived of
their fangs, and thus rendered innocuous. This opinion I
have already demonstrated as palpably erroneous. Others,
again, hold that the jugglers possess a power, by eating certain
herbs, or chewing the leaves or roots of certain plants, of
rendering themselves proof against animal poisons. In order
to render themselves perfectly secure, it is said that their
practice is to chew the herbs, to inoculate various parts of
their body with the juice, and even bathe themselves in water
in which these herbs have been steeped. It is supposed that
the bodies of the charmers thus become not merely proof
against the most deadly poison should they chance to be
bitten, but that those thus prepared exhale from their persons
an odour which produces a benumbing or stupifying effect
upon the reptiles, and renders them an easy capture. Whether
or not it be true that such is the case, we know that the
Psylli not merely profess the power of charming snakes, but
also that of curing by spells, and the application of certain
herbs, such as have been bitten by them. We are informed
by the historian and biographer Plutarch, that Cato in his
march through the desert took with him many of those persons
called Psylli (then a distinct tribe, though at the present day
that name is applied indiscriminately to all professing the art
of serpent-charming) to suck out the poison from the wounds
of any of his soldiers that might chance to be bitten by any
of the numerous venomous serpents which infested his route.
The powers of the Psylli were then always attributed to
magic, and the performers themselves took care to confirm
that opinion by accompanying the application of remedies to
their patients with muttered spells or elaborately wrought
and imposing incantations. This is a testimony respecting the
ancient repute in which charmers were held, not lightly to be
rejected.</p>

<p>While some travellers are too sceptical, I have likewise to
complain that others are too credulous. For instance, while
Dubois and Denon scout the idea of serpents being charmed at
all, Bruce asserts, and that from minute personal observation,
that all the blacks of Sennaar are completely armed by nature
against the bite of either scorpion or viper. “They will,” says
he, “take their horned snakes (there the most common and
one of the most fatal of the viper tribe) in their hands at all
times, put them in their bosoms, and throw them at one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
another as children will balls or apples, during which sport
the serpents are seldom irritated to bite, or if they do, no
mischief results from the wound.” Of course it must be evident
that Bruce in this instance ascribed rather too much to
the bounty of nature, and forgot how far art might have aided
in producing the appearance which astonished him.</p>

<p>Don Pedro D’Orbies Y. Vargas, who published in the year
1791 the result of a series of investigations he instituted to
ascertain the secret on which serpent-charming depended,
informs us that it is also extensively practised by the natives
of South America, and that they produce the wished-for end
by means of a certain plant named the quacho-mithy, so designated
from its having been first observed to have been
resorted to by the serpent-hawk, or, as the bird is sometimes
styled, the “quacho-mithy,” and by it sucked, preparatory to
its encounters with the poisonous reptiles which it fought with
and destroyed for its prey. Taking the hint from the naturally
and instinctively instructed bird, the Indians chewed the
plant thus discovered, and inoculated and washed their
bodies with its juice, rubbing it into punctures made in their
breasts, hands, and feet; and, thus prepared, they dreaded not
the bite of the most venomous snake. Don Pedro himself, and
the domestics of his household, used after these simple precautions
to venture into the thickest woods and the most dangerous
meadows, and fearlessly seize in their hands the largest
and most poisonous serpents; the creatures seemed as if under
the influence of a sort of charm or fascination, and very
rarely attempted to bite; and at any rate, even if they did, no
evil consequence resulted from the wound beyond the temporary
inconvenience produced by the laceration of the flesh by
the animals’ teeth.</p>

<p>The same gentleman to whom I was indebted for the anecdote
of the encounter with the cobra de capella, mentioned
in a preceding paper, informed me that he had detected a
snake-charmer in the act of chewing and inoculating himself
with some plant, the name or character of which he
could not however ascertain, though he offered the juggler
a considerable sum for the information. One of the leaves of
this plant, and the only one he saw, he states to have been
of a long and narrow form, with the sides indented or scolloped,
somewhat like those of our own common dandelion.</p>

<p>Now, it appears to me by no means difficult of deduction
from the facts brought forward in this and the preceding
papers on the same subject, that the secret of the snake-charmers
is dependent upon two ingredients, viz, in the first
place the employment of an antidote which will not only
mollify the effects of the reptiles’ venom, should the experimenters
happen to be bitten, but, from some peculiar odour which
it emits, stupify or intoxicate the snake, and indispose it from
violence, inclining it rather to appreciate the melody with
which they are treating it, and luxuriate in hearing of their
fife; and, in the second place, the sounds of music which the
whole class of reptiles appear more or less to be sensible of,
and which will induce the serpents to quit their holes when
they come within the sphere of the influence of the intoxicating
odour, and, abandoning themselves to its effects, fall into a
state of temporary oblivion, and are taken captive. We ourselves
are well acquainted with several substances which are
capable of producing upon such creatures as we are conversant
with in these islands, effects no less astonishing than
those produced upon the snakes by the charmers of India or
South America. It is, for instance, a very common thing,
and an experiment I have not only often seen tried, but have
tried myself dozens of times, and that with success, to charm
trout, perch, or roach, with assafœtida. If you sprinkle this
substance, finely powdered, upon the surface of the water, you
will presently see the fish crowding to the spot; and even if
you rub your hands well with it, and, gradually approaching
the water, gently immerse them in it, you will ere long find
the fish attracted towards you, and, losing their natural timidity,
actually permit themselves to be taken. Many have
imagined that it was upon the use of a certain drug that the
wonderful power possessed and successfully exerted by Sullivan,
the whisperer, depended; but for my part I think the circumstance
of Sullivan’s son having been unable to produce
similar effects, although instructed by his father in the mystery,
is sufficient to show that Sullivan’s trick depended upon
some means less certain in operation than the mere employment
of a drug would be, and in which mechanical dexterity
and personal bearing occupied places of no mean importance.</p>

<p>Rat-catchers used formerly to employ certain drugs, or combinations
of them, to collect these vermin into one place, and
thus destroy them wholesale, or to entice them into the trap;
and it has been pretended by some worthy members of this
ancient and mystic calling, that they are possessed of secrets
by which they can, if they please, draw away all the rats
from any premises on which they may be employed. I have,
however, sought after the most <em>talented</em> living professors of
rat-catching, and I cannot say I have ever witnessed miracles
equal to that. I have, however, <em>seen</em> a trap placed in a cellar
haunted by rats, and left there all night, filled next morning
with these vermin to the number of thirty, and surrounded by
a host of others, who actually could not enter from want of
room! I have <em>seen</em> a tame white rat smeared with a certain
composition, let loose in a vault, and in less than half an hour
return, followed by at least half a dozen others, who appeared
so enamoured of the white-coloured decoy, or of some scent
that hung about him, that they suffered themselves to be taken
alive in the rat-catcher’s hand, and never so much as offer to
bite. I purchased this secret from an old rat-catcher, and
have much pleasure in communicating it to the public, and
more especially to the discriminating patrons of the Irish
Penny Journal. It consists of the following simple preparation:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Recipe">
  <tr>
    <td>Powdered assafœtida</td>
    <td>2 grains.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Essential oil of rhodium</td>
    <td>3 drachms.</td>

<p>Let the assafœtida be first well triturated with the aniseed,
then add the oil of rhodium, still continuing to rub the
material well up together in a mortar, after which add the
oil of lavender, and cork up the mixture in a close bottle until
required. The method of employing this receipt is very simple,
and consists merely in smearing the decoy rat with it,
in mixing a few drops of it with a little flour or starch, and
employing the paste thus formed as a bait for the trap; and
if you anoint your hands with this mixture, you may put them
into a cage full of rats without the slightest danger of a bite.
I have done so repeatedly myself, and never got bitten unless
when I had prepared the composition improperly, or displayed
timidity in proceeding to handle the animals&mdash;a defect of demeanour
which appears capable of counteracting the working
of the charm.</p>

<p>The liking which rats exhibit for the perfume produced by
the above simple composition is truly wonderful, but will be
readily admitted, even while as yet its efficacy remains untested,
by any person who has witnessed the passion exhibited
by cats for valerian, or of dogs for galbanum, and after
much consideration and attentive observation I have come to
the conclusion that the effects produced by different substances
upon these animals have a common origin, viz., in
the peculiar odour calling into play the sexual appetite, and
that too in a more than commonly energetic manner; of
course I only mean to apply this latter observation to the
case of dogs, rats, and cats. I have no intention of thus
seeking to explain away the effect produced upon serpents or
fishes by certain odours, accompanied by music; indeed, in
these instances I should rather ascribe the effects produced to
a sort of intoxicating, fascinating influence, bearing no distant
resemblance to the power exercised towards other animals
by many of the serpent tribe themselves. The fascination
of the rattle-snake, for example, seems in a great measure
to depend upon the agency of a certain intoxicating
odour which the reptile has the power of producing at pleasure.
In support of this opinion I may adduce the testimony of
Major A. Gordon, who thus explains the fascination of serpents
in a paper read before the New York Historical Society.
He adduced various facts in support of his opinions,
and amongst the rest mentions a negro, who could by smell
alone discover a rattle-snake when in the exercise of this
power, at the distance of two hundred feet, and who, following
such indications, never failed of finding some poor animal
drawn within its vortex, and in vain struggling with the irresistible
influence. By no means remotely allied to charming
and fascination would appear to be that mysterious and as
yet doubtful power, animal magnetism, a subject on which I
shall not dilate, as it hardly falls within the limits indicated by
the heading of this paper, which has now run to a length
considerably greater than I contemplated at starting; and
consequently I think it time to take my leave, trusting I have
at least given a clue to the great secret on which depends
the magical influence of the serpent-charmer.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">WHY DO ROOTS GROW DOWNWARDS, AND
STEMS TOWARDS THE HEAVENS?</h2>

<h3>Second Article.</h3>

<p>Our readers may remember a very simple experiment, but
pregnant with important results, which we described in our
former article: namely, if an onion plant, exposed to day
light, be laid horizontally on the ground, the extremities of
the stem and roots will in the course of a few hours turn
themselves in their natural directions, the one upwards and
the other downwards; if a similar plant be placed in a dark
cellar, to which no light has access, the same things will take
place; but that which happens in a few hours in the one instance,
will require as many days in the other. From this
experiment we were led to conclude that in the production
of the proper directions of stems and roots, two classes of
causes operate, namely, the light; and, secondly, some other
principle distinct from light. Our former article was devoted
to the explanation of the manner in which light causes stems
to ascend, and roots to descend; we shall now endeavour to
investigate that other principle, less powerful, but more universal,
which shares in the production of the same phenomena.</p>

<p>If the flower stalk of the common dandelion be split vertically
into a number of portions, each of these will be seen,
spontaneously, to curl outwards; the same tendency must
be familiar to every one in celery dressed for the table; if
the root of the dandelion be split vertically into two or more
parts, these will likewise be found to curve, but in a contrary
direction from those of the stem; they will curl inwards.
We thus find that all the portions of stem placed round the
central axis have a natural tendency to curl outwards; while
all the portions of root round the central axis have a tendency
to curl inwards. The stem may be therefore considered
as consisting of a number of springs placed round a central
axis, and all endeavouring to burst away from each other;
while the root, in a like manner, may be regarded as composed
of a number of springs placed round a central axis,
and all pressing against each other. These natural tendencies
are overcome, in the living plant, by the mutual cohesion
of these parts or springs; but when this cohesion is removed
by the knife, their influence becomes acknowledged.</p>

<p>Now, if we imagine a number of springs, all of equal
strength, and either dragging away from each other or pressing
together, it will be easily understood that in such cases
perfect equilibrium should result: for, of two springs pulling
in opposite directions, for either to overcome, it is necessary
that one should be the more powerful; and the same applies
to springs pressing against each other. As long, therefore,
as a stem consists of a number of equal springs, all endeavouring
to burst away from each other, its direction will be
in a straight line; and as long as a root is composed of equal
springs pressing towards each other, its direction, likewise,
will be straight.</p>

<p>If a stem or root be placed for a certain length of time
in a horizontal position, the peculiar tendency to curvation of
its parts will become modified. If a stem which has been
thus treated be split along its axis, the part which, while it
was in a horizontal position, was superior, will have its tendency
to curl outwards increased; while that which was
under the same circumstances inferior, will have its tendency
to curl outwards diminished. If a root be placed, during a
certain period, horizontally, and then split along its axis, the
superior portion will be found to have its tendency to curl
inwards increased, while the inferior portion will have the
same tendency diminished. A horizontal position is therefore
found to increase the peculiar tendencies to curvation
of the superior parts of stems and roots, and to lessen those
of the inferior half.</p>

<p>Now, we have already ascertained that while equal springs
either pull against or press towards each other, equilibrium
is obtained; but if from any cause the springs become unequal,
the greater power may be expected to overcome the
less. When a stem or root has been kept for some time horizontally,
the upper half has its elastic power increased,
while the spring of the most depending portion has become
diminished; we have therefore now springs of unequal
power placed round a central axis, the superior being rendered
more energetic, while their antagonists have become
weakened; it is reasonable, therefore, to expect that the
respective directions of roots and stems under such circumstances
should be obedient to the excess of elasticity which
the upper half has acquired over the lower; in other words,
these stems and roots ought to direct themselves in accordance
with the natural tendencies of the superior springs which
enter into the structure of these organs. Now, the superior
springs of the stems have a natural tendency to curl outwards,
or when placed horizontally, upwards; and the superior
half of the root has an equally natural tendency to curl
inwards, or, when placed horizontally, downwards. Need we
be surprised, therefore, if in obedience to these more powerful
springs the stems and roots of vegetables shall (as
experience shows us they will do) curve, after having been
placed for some time in a horizontal position, the former upward
and the latter downward?</p>

<p>Let us now endeavour to explain the causes which produce
these peculiar and different tendencies to curvation of stems
and roots, and for this purpose it will be necessary for us to
premise, that the fleshy substance which constitutes the
basis of vegetable structure is composed of a multitude of
little vesicles or cells, each perfectly distinct in itself, and
merely adhering by its external surface with those surrounding
it, while it contains a thick syrupy liquid; these cells,
although pressed to a certain extent against each other, are
not so closely approached as to obliterate completely the
spaces existing between them, so that little passages, called
intercellular passages, continue to remain, during the life of
the plant, between the cells through which the ascending sap
rises in its passage to the buds. This ascending sap is not
so viscid a liquid as that contained in the cells: thus, the
syrupy contents of the latter must, according to the principle
of endosmose described in a previous article, absorb into
the cells the ascending sap, in a way similar to that whereby
syrup placed in a bladder, immersed in a basin of water, will
attract the latter liquid through the membrane, until the bladder
be filled. While the sap continues to ascend, therefore,
the cells must necessarily continue swollen in proportion to
their size.</p>

<p>If we examine the relative size of the cells in stems and
roots, we will meet with a remarkable phenomenon: in stems the
largest cells are situated towards the centre; but on the contrary,
in roots, the largest cells are placed near the circumference.
Now, we have ascertained in the preceding paragraph
that all the cells have a tendency to swell in proportion
to their size: it follows that the central cells of stems and
the circumferential cells of roots possess the greatest tendency
to swell. The centre of a stem has therefore greater
elasticity than the circumference, while the circumference of
a root has greater elasticity than the centre. When this
elasticity in either case is permitted to exert itself by means
of a vertical section, it causes each half of the stem to curl
outwards, and each half of the root to curl inwards. If the
influence of endosmose be acknowledged, the explanation is
perfect.</p>

<p>But it may be said, what proof have we that endosmose
operates in these cases? An experiment instituted by Dutrochet,
and repeated by the writer of this article, sufficiently
demonstrates its influence. A plant of dandelion was immersed
in syrup, and after a certain time the root and stalk
were severally split in a vertical direction: the tendencies to
incurvation of these organs were now seen to be completely
changed from what they are under ordinary circumstances;
the parts of the stalk curled inwards, those of the root outwards:
this was exactly what might be expected, if we
suppose endosmose to be the cause of these phenomena;
placed in syrup, this thick fluid attracted liquid out of the
cells, which consequently shrunk in place of expanding; and
the larger cells contracting more than the smaller, the former
elasticities became reversed.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen why it is that when roots and stems
are planted for some time in a horizontal position, the proper
elasticities of the superior parts become increased, while
those of the inferior become diminished. These phenomena
can be explained by recollecting that the ascending sap is a
heterogeneous fluid, composed of mucilage and syrup, mixed
with light water and carbonic acid, which have been drawn
up unchanged from the extremities of the roots, and are destined
to escape, or undergo decomposition in the leaves. It
is not difficult to imagine that this heterogeneous fluid contained
in the intercellular passages should be subjected to
the influence of gravity; if this be admitted, we can then
understand how in a horizontal root or stem the heavier and
more viscid portion of the sap should descend into the inferior
half, and the lighter ascend between the cells of the superior
half; endosmose will take place in proportion to the difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
of density between the liquid in the intercellular passages
and that contained in the cells; therefore it will take
place more energetically in the superior half, where is the
lighter fluid; and as the elasticity depends upon the energy of
endosmose, the upper portion will, according to its nature,
curve with greater force, while the elasticity of the lower
part will be lessened. This explanation acquires increased
weight from the fact that the specific gravity of the most
depending portions of stems and roots growing horizontally
in the dark, is greater than that of the upper.</p>

<p>But we have stronger arguments in favour of the supposition
that gravity is essentially connected with the several
directions of stems and roots. These directions take place
naturally in the “line of gravity,” that is, parallel to a
line drawn from the centre of the mass towards the centre of
the earth; at the same time it is to be remarked, that
although roots grow in the direction of gravity, that is, towards
the centre of the earth, stems grow in exactly the opposite
way. An experiment made by Mr Knight has been
repeated by different philosophers, to determine whether these
directions of stems and roots bear to other physical laws
the same relation they do to gravity. Seeds permitted to
germinate in wet moss were attached to the circumference of
a wheel made to revolve constantly in a vertical manner;
under these circumstances the roots grew outwards, away
from the circumference of the wheel, and the stems towards
its centre; the roots were thus found to obey the centrifugal
force, and the stems the centripetal; but while the wheel revolved
vertically, gravity and the centrifugal force were
operating in the same direction. It was necessary to cause
them to act in different directions, and for this purpose the
wheel was made to revolve horizontally: in this case the centrifugal
force acted at right angles to the line of gravity, and
it was accordingly found, in obedience to the law of the composition
of forces, that the roots no longer grew towards the
centre of the earth, nor towards the circumference of the
wheel, but in a plane between these two forces; and the angle
which they formed with the line of gravity could be rendered
more or less acute by increasing or diminishing the velocity
with which the wheel rotated. It was thus made evident that
roots and stems were influenced by physical laws, although
growing in opposite directions.</p>

<p>We have thus shown why roots grow downwards and
stems towards the heavens: in the dark these things arise
through the influence of gravity controlling endosmose, and
thus producing the proper incurvations of the parts of stems
and roots. Under the influence of light the same phenomena
more energetically arise from the agency of this element over
vegetable growth.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">THE LADY WITH THE SPECTACLES.</h2>

<p>Beauty in spectacles is like Cupid in knee breeches, or the
Graces with pocket handkerchiefs&mdash;an excrescence of refinement;
an innovation of the ideas which spiritualize woman
into a goddess; a philosophical blossom of the “march of
mind.” Beauty in spectacles! and has it come to this?
Burke said that the age of chivalry was past, and publishers
say that the age of poetry has followed it; powder and periwigs
destroyed the one, and spectacles have gone far to annihilate
the other. Think of the queen of beauty of some
tournament&mdash;thanks to my Lord Eglintoun for making such
words familiar to us&mdash;looking on the encountering knights
through a patent pair of spectacles!&mdash;picture to yourself a
beautiful and romantic young lady parting from her lover,
taking the “first long lingering kiss of love,” as pretty Miss
Pardoe terms it, and just imagine the figure the spectacles
would cut in such an encounter; think of Mary Queen of
Scots, Lady Jane Grey, Scott’s “Jewess,” or Shakspeare’s
“Lady Macbeth,” with such appendages! I think of a heroine
in a novel taking off her spectacles to shed “salt tears” for
her lover’s absence, or in the emotion of a distressing juncture
throwing herself at the feet of some obdurate tyrant,
breaking the lenses of her “sight preservers;” think of all
this, and judge of the effect which spectacles, as an ornament,
have upon romance. Beauty has three stages&mdash;the coy, the
dignified, and the intellectual. The first exists until about
twenty, the second until twenty-five, and the last until beauty
has made unto itself wings and flown away. It is in this last
stage that women wear spectacles. The symptoms of spectacles
begin at an early age. The young Miss has a primness,
a staidness, and a miniature severity of aspect, at
variance from her years. They never seem young; there
is no freshness of heart in them: they become women faster
than other girls, and become old faster than other women;
they are remarkable for thin lips, sharp noses, and white
artificial teeth. They are walking strictures upon human
life&mdash;bleak visions of philosophy in petticoats&mdash;daughters, not
it would seem of love, but of Fellows of the Royal Society!
They are fond of phrenology and meetings of scientific associations.
They like a good pew in church, and write long
letters to their unfortunate “friends in the country.” They
are generally spinsters, or, if married, motherless. No young
wife with “six small children” ever wore spectacles. They
go a good deal into company, where they are seen seated on
sofas talking to ladies older than themselves, or turning over
the leaves of a book, and with interesting abstraction poring
over it. They dance quadrilles, but never waltz. Heaven
and earth! think of a pair of spectacles whirling in a waltz.
They have a genius for the “scholastic profession,” and frequently
exercise it as amateurs “never eat suppers;” and
are, many of them, members of the Horticultural Society.
The lady with the spectacles! Half a century ago this would
have been understood to refer to some one stricken in years,
but now-a-days infirmity of eye-sight has been raised to the
rank of a charm. The moment spectacles become really
useful they are abandoned; it is the harmonious combination
of youth and short-sightedness which gives beauty to the
guise. Intense interest is expected to be felt towards her,
who, still young and lovely, abandons the frivolities of her sex
for the calm secluded pleasures of intellect. This is the point
our heroines aim at. But we have done with them. They
may be very good in their way, but their ways are not as our
ways. Flirts, coquettes, prudes, and a host of other orders
into which the sex are classified, have their failings, but they,
at least, are women; while the “lady with the spectacles”
seems hardly a daughter of Eve, but a mysterious being; a
new creation, come into the world to gladden the lovers of
modern science, and patronise the house of Solomons and Co.&mdash;<cite>Court
Gazette.</cite></p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Marriage.</span>&mdash;It is the happiest and most virtuous state of
society, in which the husband and wife set out early together,
make their property together, and with perfect sympathy of
soul graduate all their expenses, plans, calculations and desires,
with reference to their present means, and to their
future and common interest. Nothing delights me more than
to enter the neat little tenement of the young couple, who
within perhaps two or three years, without any resources but
their own knowledge or industry, have joined heart and hand,
and engage to share together the responsibilities, duties, interests,
trials, and pleasures of life. The industrious wife
is cheerfully employing her own hands in domestic duties,
putting her house in order, or mending her husband’s clothes,
or preparing the dinner, whilst, perhaps, the little darling sits
prattling upon the floor, or lies sleeping in the cradle&mdash;and
everything seems preparing to welcome the happiest of husbands
and the best of fathers, when he shall come from his
toil to enjoy the sweets of his little paradise. This is the true
domestic pleasure, the “only bliss that survived the fall.”
Health, contentment, love, abundance, and bright prospects,
are all here. But it has become a prevalent sentiment, that
a man must acquire his fortune before he marries&mdash;that the
wife must have no sympathy, nor share with him in the pursuit
of it, in which most of the pleasure truly consists; and
the young married people must set out with as large and expensive
an establishment as is becoming those who have been
wedded for 20 years. This is very unhappy. It fills the
community with bachelors, who are waiting to make their
fortunes, endangering virtue and promoting vice&mdash;it destroys
the true economy and design of the domestic institution, and
it promotes idleness and inefficiency among females, who are
expecting to be taken up by a fortune, and passively sustained,
without any care or concern on their part&mdash;and thus
many a wife becomes, as a gentleman once remarked, not a
“help-mate,” but a “help-eat.”&mdash;<cite>Winslow.</cite></p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
